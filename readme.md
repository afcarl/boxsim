**boxsim** is a small wrapper around [**playbox**](github.com/humm/playbox) that allows you to create and control **playbox** simulations from python.

It was created to support code for  [experiments on sensorimotor learning](http://fabien.benureau.com). It might somehow be useful to you, especially if you want to rerun, check or tweak the aforementioned experiments.
